DreamGL is an OpenGL-like graphics library written completely from scratch. The current release only supports Sony's Playstation2 console.

The code is not based on any existing OpenGL code base. It was developed independently, with the aim of taking complete advantage of the target hardware platform.

The current API subset is based on the 1.1 OpenGL specification and is similar in functionalty to the MiniGL drivers used by games like id's Quake I and II.

Any constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated.

# GREETS!

**Napalm** - For getting everything started with NAPLINK, which I still use!

**Soopadoopa** - For the totally awsome Funslower demo and source code. I have learned and have yet to learn more from this demo than anything else.

**Oobles** - ps2dev.org, need I say more!

**adresd, blackd_wd, dayta, hiryu, jenova, jules, longchair, mrbrown, nagra, norecess, now3d, pukko, sg2, sjeep** - great bunch of guys, always friendly and happy to help out a soul in need! *cough*

**Everyone else from #ps2dev** on EFNet who didn't happen to be on when I wrote this.

Cheers,
